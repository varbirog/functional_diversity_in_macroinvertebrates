# Abstract
As events of flow intermittency are expected to increase in our surface waters in the future, understanding how macroinvertebrate assemblages respond to it in lowland streams at a functional level will be essential for effective stream management and conservation. This study examines the functional response of macroinvertebrate communities to flow intermittency in Hungarian lowland streams across the whole functional community, trait groups, and trait states levels, focusing on comparisons between intermittent and perennial streams. Using biological data collected over a 10-months sampling campaign, we assessed various functional metrics, including functional richness, evenness, divergence, dispersion, and Rao's quadratic entropy, to determine the most effective metric for revealing the response at each functional level.  Our findings indicate lower or equivalent functional diversity in intermittent streams compared to perennial ones across all functional metrics, suggesting a potential disparity in functional trait composition. Significant differences were observed within trait groups, indicating trait group-specific responses to intermittency. Furthermore, we identified specific trait states  that lead to functional differences between intermittent and perennial streams, elucidating the mechanisms underlying functional composition. The divergence between changes occurring at the state or trait group level and their manifestation at higher organizational (community) levels underscores the significance of comprehending intricate interactions and dynamics within functional communities.  We recommend considering different trait groups when assessing community responses to environmental disturbances such as drought in future studies.
